# Back-end APP: JS/Node.js/Express/MongoDB complete server
A small new backend app that allows adding a RESTfull API, authentication, security and file upload features, to boost an existing frontend project. This project is carried out with the aim of mastering back-end technologies (Node, Express and MongoDB).

Using back-end technologies (Node, Express and MongoDB) I created a complete server allowing to interact with a database and to exploit the front-end part already developed and which you can download here : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/go-fullstack-v3-fr .
